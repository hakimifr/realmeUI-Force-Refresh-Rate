magisk module to force refresh rate on realme UI

## How to use
1. Clone the repo
2. cd to the repo
3. Pack the file with zip or 7z
4. Open magisk and flash the module

*note: you could remove the .git directory before zipping, but the installer already has .git removal logic*

## Side note

2. For 120hz device that's on realme UI 1, I don't know if this will work,
   you're free to test it and let me know.
